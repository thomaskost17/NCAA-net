# NCAA-net

This is an attempt to apply deep learning to the NCAA tournamnet. Basketball is one of the most highly documented sports. With so much data existing it beggs the question as to wether a nerual net is capable of learning from these patterns to create a "good" bracket at the end of the season. The prize for good performance is not bad motivation either!
